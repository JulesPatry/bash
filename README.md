## Find-Replace

[Find-Replace](https://github.com/JulesPatry/bash/blob/main/find-replace.sh) is a function used to filter only files with a specific line of text, and then trigger a find and replace for another specific text. Helpful for updating files that share a common line of text and then change an additional line of text from just those files.
