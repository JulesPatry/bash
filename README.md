## Find-Replace

[Find-Replace](https://github.com/JulesPatry/bash/blob/main/find-replace.sh) is a function used to filter only files with a specific line of text, then run find and replace for a different text query on those filtered files. Helpful for updating files that share a common line of text (like an import or object key) and then be able to change a separate line of text from just those filtered files.
